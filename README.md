# Generative AI ComputerVision

This project involves building a web application that enables users to replace the background of an image using AI-powered segmentation and inpainting techniques. The app leverages Facebook's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate a precise segmentation mask, isolating the subject from the background. Once the mask is obtained, Stable Diffusion's inpainting model fills in the background based on a user-provided text prompt, creating a seamless and visually appealing composite. The entire process is optimized for GPU acceleration, ensuring efficient processing. An interactive interface allows users to upload images, refine selections, and generate creative background replacements in real time.
